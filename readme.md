# Multilanguage BuddyPress with Polylang

This plugin allows you to do a [Polylang](https://de.wordpress.org/plugins/polylang/) powered multilanguage WordPress installation with [BuddyPress](https://de.wordpress.org/plugins/buddypress/).
 
**Attention**: This is an early try out develope version of this plugin.
 
## Installation
   
### 1. Activate and setup the Plugins 
   
At first yo need to have installed and activated the BuddyPress (configuring components and pages) and Polylang (added the languages you need in your site) plugins from WordPress.org. After you have setup BuddyPress and Polylang, you now can switch on the _Multilanguage BuddyPress with Polylang_ plugin. 
   
### 2. Add the BuddyPress pages for every language
   
You need to add every page you refered in the BuddyPress settings for every language again and refer it to the main language page on the right side of your page. 
   
## Further development
 
We are going on to add support for multilanguage for Emails. If you have any other ideas, please let us know and create an issue for this.
